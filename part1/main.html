                                It’s been a while since I’ve posted (sorry, I’m still working hard on my next book) and
                                hadn’t planned to post but this piece from Terry on Rosie’s blog deserves to be spread far and wide.
                                If you are an author and you ask someone for their honest opinion of your work, don’t get upset 
                                if they give it. Book bloggers are treasures. They should be encouraged, praised, and if possible
                                given red wine and chocolates. These wonderful people give up their time, for free, to review books.
                                And as every book is a piece of art, whether they like it or not is subjective (if you don’t believe me,
                                look up the one-star reviews on your favourite book). A well-thought out review is a gift, whether positive 
                                or negative, and if you don’t think you can react well to somebody not liking your book, then you should 
                                think long and hard about publishing it at all.

                                        … me! I have to admit, I was a little dubious about NaNoWriMo before starting. 
                                        Yes, I saw the value of creating a community of like-minded individuals all 
                                        focussing on one goal, but at the same time 1667 words a day, while not a huge 
                                        amount on a single day, is a lot of writing day in, day out, for a month.From 
                                        a personal point of view, the month of November wasn’t exactly quiet. Along 
                                        with work and being there for my family, I’d also recently taken on learning 
                                        a set of songs for a duet, there was my oldest son’s tenth birthday split over 
                                        two weekends (as the birthday fell on a Wednesday) and I had committed to 
                                        starting a cricket coaching course at the end of the month, ruling out more 
                                        weekend writing time. Yet in the end, I did it and with more than a week to 
                                        spare! So what have I learned?

                                        When writing my first three novels, on a good day i could hit between 2000 to
                                        2500 words. My best was just over 3000 words, yet there were a number of times 
                                        during the past month where I wrote well over 4000 words in a day. This may

                                        I’ve always been a believer of not looking back when writing your first draft 
                                        but this year I took it a step further than I’ve done in the past. Where I used 
                                        to correct the odd sentence or paragraph I was which I was particularly unhappy, 
                                        for NaNoWriMo I just left comments in red all over my MS on areas I felt needed 
                                        work or where I had a change of plan, but then carried on going. While this was 
                                        a great help to hit the word count, it will be interesting to see how the first 
                                        rewrite goes!

                                        One of my favourite discoveries during NaNoWriMo was how much fun over-writing 
                                        is. What do I mean by this? In my case it was allowing myself to describe settings
                                        or characters in more detail than was needed, or to write far too much exposition 
                                        than would be in the final book. This is a big change for me. I usually write 
                                        sparingly and go back to add further detail later, but this time around 
                                        over-writing really helped me get under the skin of the world and the story I 
                                        created. I know a lot of what I’ve written will be (rightly) cut during the edit 
                                        but it has been fun letting myself go a allowing myself time to explore the people 
                                        and settings I’ve created.

                                        I’ve always maintained that one of the best things about writing is the supportive 
                                        community, and through NaNoWriMo I’ve got to meet a lot of new supportive and 
                                        encouraging writers. Sadly I haven’t been able to go to any meet ups but the 
                                        response on the NaNoWriMo regional message board has been really positive. Next 
                                        year I’ll definitely attend. <br> <br> Of course, my first draft isn’t finished. 
                                        I’m not sure whether I’ll hit my extended goal of finishing it by the end of the 
                                        month but it will be really close and I can’t wait to then get my teeth into it 
                                        and start editing in the new year. <br> <br> So what about you? If you’ve taken 
                                        part in NaNoWriMo this year, what has been your experience? If you haven’t, have I 
                                        persuaded you to do it next year? I look forward to hearing from you.
